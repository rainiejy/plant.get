## Inspiration

We thought about creating a solution to a simple dilemma of decision paralysis. Our website offers users a way to pick their best suited plant, saving time and money. We were inspired by online quizzes and the much-loved hobby of raising plants. 

## Functionalities

We built a website that gives users a personalized plant type based on their preferences and lifestyle. We checked for the amount of sunlight, water, maintenance level, price, location, and if there were flowers or not. 

## Programming Languages
We built it using HTML, CSS, and Javascript on Replit.

## Challenges 
The code sometimes did not work the way we wanted it to, i.e. not showing the correct results or not continuing to the next stage of the quiz. There were a lot of formatting issues.

## What we're proud of
We are proud of the fact that we were able to get the site running smoothly and looking nice. 

## What we learned
We learned how to create websites from scratch. And we ended up learning a lot of random information about plants. :))

## What's next 
First of all, we can add a whole lot more plants. We currently only have 19 plants but later we could add more plants and also expand on our quiz by adding more questions that narrow down the perfect plant type for users. We also plan to work on formatting the quiz better so that the buttons of the answer choices are always on separate lines, independent of screen size. The weighting system can also be tested more rigorously to ensure the plant recommendations are more accurate (for example, ensuring that selecting “Flowers, please” will recommend a plant that actually has flowers on it.
